I am currently an IT student at Vaasa University of Applied Sciences and I´m based in Vaasa, Finland. I build stuff too.

This year, I have achieved 2nd prize award of Hackathon "The UAS of the future" through Kurry Mobile Focus App. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code. ✨😍

### What I'm focusing on 👨‍💻

Currently improving my coding skills: Python, C/C++, Golang.<br />
BTW, if you´re looking for a Discord word game, take a look at this [Kagari Discord Bot](https://https://github.com/VietNguyen408/KagariBot).
